      <P>Agriculture and its development are very important to the economy of a nation because of the reasons:
       <ol>
         <li><h3>Agriculture provides food</h3></li>
         <p>Food is absolutely assential to life.Without food,life on earth will gradually cease. Various kind of crops are grown to provide
           essential food materials.Livestock is reared to provide meat,milk and eggs.Fishes and other water-dwelling species are also reared 
           for food.The provision of food is a basic responsibility of agriculture.A well-fed population is energetic,economically productive
           and enjoys better heath. This result in the creation of greater national wealth.
         </p>
         <li><h3>Agriculture provide material for clothing and footwear</h3></li>
         <p>Good cloths and shoes meet the need of human beings for covering their bodies, protection from unfavourable weather elements and
           fashion.
         </p>
         <li><h3>Agriculture provides material for making medicine</h3></li>
         <p>medicine and medicinal materials contribute very significantly towards ensuring that human beings live in good health.
           these medicines and materials are largely derived from plant and animals.Through agriculture, these materials are produced in

          <li><h3>THE IMOTA RICE MILL</h3></li>

            <p>Thus,as part of the effort aimed at boosting the production of rice in lagos,the state government announced in 2017,its plants
              to expand the rice mills at imota from 2.5 metric tonnes per hour to 16 metric tonnes per hour while at the same time encouraging
              private sector operators to invest in rice processing.The almost completed imota rice mill is located in Ikorodu,Lagos state.
            </p>
            <p>According to the state immediate past commissioner for Agriculture, Gbolahan lawal,the mill will ensure a steady supply of freshly
              processed rice of about 2.4 million bags of 50 kilograms per annum to lagosians,in addition to over 250,000 jobs that will be created
              in both the upstream and downstream sectors of the rice value chain.
            </p>
            <p>Rice is one of the major staple foods in Nigeria,consumed across all geopolitical zones and sociaeconomic classes in Nigeria.
              However,only about 57% of the 6.7 million metric tonnes of rice consumed in Nigeria annually is locally produced,leading to a supply
              deficit of about 3 million metric tonnes.
            </p>
            <p>With the rapid growth in the country's population which was estimate to have exceeded 200 million in 2019,it expected that the demand
              for rice would rapidly increase in the foreseable future.In view of this the federal government of Nigeria.Announced the closure of the 
              country's land borders in august 2019 to prevent the important of rice and other good the can be locally produced into the country.this
              was done to encourage the local production of rice by the indigenous farmer.<a href="http://google.com">Read more</a>

  </div>

  Vices are forms of evil, wicked and criminal actions or behaviours in the society. Vices are social problems and have been thought of as
   social situations that a large number of observers feel are inappropriate and need remedying. Vices are those acts and conditions that
    violate societal norms and values.

   <h3>What are the type of social vices</h3>
    Some of the social vices include but not limited to examination malpractice, indecent dressing and prostitution, political thuggery,
     cultism, drug addiction, targeted assassinations, armed robbery, pipe-line vandalism, vandalism of electricity installations and cyber
      crimes.
    <h3>What are the causes of social vices</h3>
      Peer pressure is a major cause of vices in the society. Another cause of social vices is negligence by the parents or a broken home.
       Most children that engage themselves in vices are from broken homes. Lack of parental care, supervision and attention can make a child
        engage in social vices.
